I Worked as Front-End developer using the company CMS solution based on PHP/CakePHP trying to create a good user experience.

Started to work with Back-End development where in some projects I worked as Front-end too, I started to learn Drupal and Wordpress and getting several projects to maintain using CakePHP, Symfony2 and Node.js.

On my current work I help maintain a CMS and RESTful API that is used to organize documents that is used for sales and for that we use CakePHP, Symfony2 and ElasticSearch.

All the document structure are based in tree node and all the relations are based on taxonomy.
 
The RESTful API is used to by a third party to maintain the documents updated and for an iPad application.

The ElasticSearch is used to help on the search of documents.
